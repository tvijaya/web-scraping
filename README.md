# web-scraping


### In this part, I will be scraping Nasa Website, collecting information such as: Mars News, Weather, Featured image from their website, Facts and Hemispheres.
I will be using Splinter to navigate the website and scrape the data using Beautiful Soup. When the user clicks on "Scrape New Data", the python script runs the code, scrapes needed information and saves it to MongoDB. It then redirects the user to same page using Flask and displays the new information to them.
